# Coding Test: Mini CRM

This is a mini CRM coded by Michael Hospedales. It performs general CRUD functions and even provides a search bar that works with the first name, last name and email address.

All fields are required when creating a user.

## Installation

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this package. 

Use the package manager [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) to install the mini CRM and its dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The navigation is pretty standard with the addition of the search bar on every page.

Once a user has been created

This will load up the Next.js server which you can connect to at http://localhost:3000/
